/* 
SELECT statement that allows you to query data from a single table.
If you have two or more statements, you use the semicolon ( ;) to separate them so that MySQL will execute each statement individually.
MySQL evaluates the FROM clause first and then the SELECT clause:

 /* 
 to sort a result set use the MySQL ORDER BY clause.
 he ORDER BY clause is always evaluated after the FROM and SELECT clause.
 By default, the ORDER BY clause uses ASC

/* 
The WHERE clause allows you to specify a search condition for the rows returned by a query
Besides the SELECT statement, you can use the WHERE clause in the UPDATE or DELETE statement to specify which rows to update or delete.
the WHERE clause is evaluated after the FROM clause and before the SELECT clause.
or,and,like,between,in,limit
MySQL always evaluates the OR operators after the AND operators. To change the order of evaluation,  use the parentheses
When evaluating an expression that has the AND operator, MySQL stops evaluating the remaining parts of the expression 
whenever it can determine the result. This function is called short-circuit evaluation
expr [NOT] BETWEEN begin_expr AND end_expr;
 All three expressions:  expr,  begin_expr, and  end_expr must have the same data type.
 The BETWEEN operator returns true if the value of the  expr is greater than or equal to (>=) the value of  
 begin_expr and less than or equal to (<= ) the value of the  end_expr, otherwise, it returns zero
 The NOT BETWEEN returns true if the value of  expr is less than (<) the value of the  begin_expr or greater than the value of 
 the value of  end_expr, otherwise, it returns 0.
 If any expression is NULL, the BETWEEN operator returns  NULL .
 
 The IN  operator allows you to determine if a specified value matches any value in a set of values or returned by a subquery.

If you use the GROUP BY clause in the SELECT statement without using aggregate functions, the GROUP BY clause behaves like the DISTINCT clause.
The GROUP BY clause groups a set of rows into a set of summary rows 
the GROUP BY clause returns unique occurrences of values.
To filter the groups returned by GROUP BY clause, you use a  HAVING clause.
